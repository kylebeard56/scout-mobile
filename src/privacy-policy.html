              <br><h4>Cookies and Data Cache</h4> We may use cookies, data cache, web
              beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Application
              to help customize the Application and improve your experience. When you access
              the Application, your personal information is not collected through the use of
              tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You
              can remove or reject cookies but be aware that such action could affect the
              availability and functionality of the Application. You may not decline web
              beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or
              by modifying your web browser’s settings to notify you each time a cookie is
              tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies on an individual
              basis.<br>

              <br><h4>Website Analytics</h4> We may also partner with
              selected third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to
              allow tracking technologies and remarketing services on the
              Application through the use of first party cookies and
              third-party cookies, to, among other things, analyze and track
              users’ use of the Application, determine the popularity of
              certain content, and better understand online activity. By
              accessing the Application, you consent to the collection and
              use of your information by these third-party vendors. You are
              encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them
              directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer
              personal information to these third-party vendors. However, if
              you do not want any information to be collected and used by
              tracking technologies, you can install and/or update your
              settings for one of the following:
              <a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics">Google Firebase Analytics</a>

              <br><br> You should be aware that getting a new mobile device,
              installing a new operating system, upgrading an existing
              operating system, or erasing or otherwise altering your
              device’s cookies files may also clear certain opt-out cookies,
              plug-ins, or settings.

                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems [and our mobile
                applications] include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate
                to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
                activities monitored and collected.  No uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.  If a standard
                for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
                you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
